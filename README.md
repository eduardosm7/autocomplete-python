# autocomplete-python

This project has the objective of studying some data structures (trie, chained list), UI using PyQt and some autocomplete mechanics.

The program consists on the user entering the name of the data file (i.e. cities.txt), then he can choose which data structute will be used to store the data, and the number of suggestions the autocomplete algorithm will display. After all have been set, finally the user will enter the text in the search box as the program displays the results and the total time it took to run the algorithm.
